This README will serve as a description, as well as a track list of things that I want accomplished with this web app.  I intened to make this web app be used for stonk prices.  It will evenetually be able to send out alerts for specific stocks when they're trading erratically, and build from there.  
Initial Functionality:
1.  Grab single stock price data
2.  Retreives single stock price thenmakes comparisions based on previous day.
3.  Sends out an email alert if the price has changed more than x %.
